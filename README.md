## Background
Pymaceuticals is a pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego, CA. This company specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals who began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring for of skin cancer.



## Script
Using Pymaceuticals animal study record which consisted of 249 mice with SCC tumor growth that were treated over a course of 45 days through a variety of drug regimens. Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin was compared with other treatment regiments. A technical report was created based on multiple plots using the data collected using `Python`, `Pandas`, `Numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot` and `scipy.stats` libraries.

## Results
The final report includes the following:

* Summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.
* Bar plot showing Total number of measurements taken for each treatment regimen throughout the course of the study.
* Pie plot showing the distribution of Female or Male mice in the study.
* Using the Final Tumor Volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin), calculated the quartiles and IQR   and quantitatively determined any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens.
* Box and Whisker plot of the Final Tumor Volume for all four treatment regimens and highlighted any potential outliers by changing color and style.
* Line plot of Tumor Volume vs Timepoint for any mouse treated with Capomulin.
* Scatter plot of average mouse Weight vs average Tumor Volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen.
* Calculated the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between average mouse Weight vs average Tumor Volume for the Capomulin treatment and Plotted the linear         regression model on top of previous scatter plot.
* Technical report included three observations or inferences that can be made from the data. This information was included at the top of the notebook.
